Each player gets a unique role: one will be the cunning Impostor, while the others are Word Detectives armed with the secret word.

Pass the phone around to reveal your role. The Impostor's goal? Blend in and avoid detection by pretending to know the word. The Word Detectives must use their wits to uncover the Impostor in their midst. Can you deceive your friends and emerge victorious, or will you be unmasked as the Impostor?
